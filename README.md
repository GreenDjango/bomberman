#### The aim of the **Indie Studio** is to implement a cross-platform 3D video game with real-world tools.
[Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) is a well known game, where you control a character that have to kills the other players on the map with bomb. You can play in multiplayer or against AIs.

Our gameplay reference is [Neo Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Bomberman), released on the Neo Geo and MVS systems in 1997. You can play up to two players on the same PC, on Versus or again AI.

The project is composed with two library all in **C++** : the 3D engine **[Irrlicht 1.8.4](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/)** and the part of library **[SFML-audio 2.5](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)**.
